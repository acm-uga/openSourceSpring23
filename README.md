<b> <h1> Our Project: UGA Marketplace</h1></b>

This is a hub of information and services made specifically for UGA students by UGA students. Our goal is to build features that offer solutions to common issues that students face, and to continue adding features as new needs arise. We reserve access to UGA students only by requiring a @uga.edu email address to sign up.

<b> <h2> How it Works </h2></b>
<img width="950" alt="Screen Shot 2023-02-14 at 3 02 25 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87153798/218848652-0940c29d-f03c-44f9-8f91-1c24b80f2f76.png">
<br>

<b> <h2> Initial features </h2></b>

<b> Market Page: </b>
A place to buy and sell common goods that college students need, like textbooks and dorm items.
Security is often an issue when using other sites. Here, you know that the person you are making the exchange with is also a student at UGA.

<b> Student Housing Page:</b>
Finding the right on and off campus housing for you can be difficult. This feature has all on and off campus housing options in one place so that you don’t have to explore multiple websites.
Students can comment on each dorm or apartment complex to let others know about their experience living there.
Subleases can be advertised here similar to how it is done on Facebook marketplace, but with better filters, information, and security. 

<b> Course Swap Page:</b>
This is for situations where you realize a different class / section would work better for your schedule, but both sections are full.
Users would advertise which class they would like to drop and which classe(s) they would be willing to swap their spot for.

<b> <h2> To Run The App </h2></b>

1. Execute: <b>cd my-app</b>
- This is the directory that was created after creating the react application with the “npx create-react-app my-app” command.
You must be inside this directory to run the application

2. Execute: <b>npm install</b>
- This installs all of the packages and dependencies in the node_modules folder. This will take a few seconds
Execute: npm start

3. Execute: <b>npm start dev</b>
- This runs the application in development mode, so you don't have to re-run application to see changes everytime
